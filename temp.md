Here’s a simple example of a **for loop in Python**:

```python
# Print numbers from 1 to 5
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

### How it works:

*   `range(1, 6)` generates numbers from **1 to 5** (6 is excluded).
*   `for i in range(1, 6):` means: for each number in that range, assign it to `i` and run the indented code.
*   `print(i)` outputs the current value of `i`.

Would you like me to also show:
✅ A **for loop in another language** (like Java or C)?  
✅ A **for loop that iterates over a list of items**?  
✅ Or a **real-world example**, like summing numbers or processing data?
